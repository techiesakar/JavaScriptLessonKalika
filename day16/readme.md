for hour

for 12 hours - 360 deg
for one hour = 360/12 = 30deg

for h hour = h\*30 deg

one hour = 60 min = 30 deg
1 min = 30/60 = 1/2 deg

for m minute = m/2 deg

for one hour total deg = h\*30 + m/2

--- for minutes
60 minute = 360 deg
one minute = 360/60 = 6 deg
for m minute = 6\*m deg

-- for seconds
60 s = 360 deg
one second = 6 deg

for s second = 6 \* s
